				<p>
					The <a href='http://www.sca.org'
					title='Society for Creative Anachronism'>SCA</a> is an international organization dedicated to researching and re-creating the arts and skills of pre-seventeenth century Europe. The SCA "Known World" consists of 19 kingdoms, with over 30,000 members in countries around the world. Members, dressed in clothing of the Middle Ages and Renaissance attend events which feature tournaments, royal courts, feasts, dancing, educational classes and workshops, and much more.

					<p>
						The hats can be plain rolled brim style, or decorated with flowers of various kinds, or buttons of various kinds. 
						There are berets, and open topped hats in plain or complicated styles,
						as well as something I think of only as headbands, along with 
						a slightly different style of "ear warmers" that could be considered a type of hats too.

					<p>
						We have multiple different kinds of flowers available.
						They can be added to any other work, be attached to a hair-clip or a hat, or even just as a stand-alone decoration.
						Orchids, roses and daffodils are currently available. With the variety of colours and fibres available, any combination could work.
						In any decorating situation there will be something that can be improved by the addition of a flower or two.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ladies, if your 'man' is too manly for the brighter colours, try Green Camouflage or Grey, or even Silver.
